# Distributed Application State with Akka and Kotlin

This project demonstrates distribution of application state in a resilient and scalable
manner. To achieve this we made use of the Akka JVM toolkit and actor-based concurrency
model, this toolkit has bindings for Java and the JVM language Scala. Tooling around
Scala is particularly strong as this the language of choice for the libraries Authors. 
 
This project is a port of the insightful [proof-of-concept][1] written by Michael Read
and discussed in detail his [blog posts][2].
